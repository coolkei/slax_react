# Theming

Admin theming is handled by [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/customization/themes). [See these docs](http://www.material-ui.com/#/customization/themes) for more information.

## Customization

Customization can be done via a ["theme"](http://www.material-ui.com/#/customization/themes), or via [inline styles](http://www.material-ui.com/#/customization/styles).

Pre-defined colors available for customizing or creating your own theme can be also found [here in Material UI's docs](http://www.material-ui.com/#/customization/colors)
